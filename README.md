D# 3layers_neuralnet

## Overview
 This is 3 layers neural network.

## Description
 I subject to following rules.
 - I use only standard liblary.
 - All the code is placed in a single file (source.py).
 
## Development environment
- Using computer  : OPTIPLEX 9020 (dell)
- Cpu : intel core i7 vPro
- Memory : 8GB
- Programming language : python
- Python version : 3.6.1 (anaconda 4.4.0)
- IDE : pycharm
- Other software : sourceTree

## Usage
 Python 3.6 execution environment is required.
 and This program requires Mnist gzip dataset and source.py to be same directory. 

## Demo
 Following image is this program's result sample.

## Optional Issue
 - I write solving overflow problem (at caluculating sigmoid exp).
 - I implemented this program with dropout algolism in branch. but it was needless because overfitting didn't happen.
